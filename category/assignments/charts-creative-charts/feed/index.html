				<description><![CDATA[Aneesh Agrawal, Kenny Friedman, and Katie Marlowe The data show routes that people commonly take by using Hubways. We want to tell this story because Hubway can be a great alternative transportation for routes that the MBTA does not cover. Our data came from hubwaydatachallenge.org, which was a challenge in 2012 to visualize data from Hubway rides. Our data includes information on rides from 2011-2013. We picked a chord chart to visualize this data because &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/03/03/hubway-rides-by-neighborhood-over-time/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Hubway Rides by Neighborhood over Time</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Group members: Michelle Thomas, Reem Alfaiz, Andrew Mikofalvy The data shows the effectiveness of negative ad campaigns as well as their tendency to be used as a last resort in gaining support and lowering support for competitors. We wanted to tell this story because of the over saturation of campaign ads and curiosity over the effectiveness of negativity. We used data from the Politcal TV Ad Archive to look at which candidates negative ads were &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/03/03/do-smear-campaigns-work/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Do Smear Campaigns work?</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Team members: Kalki Seksaria, Gary Burnett, Michael Drachkovitch, Argyro Nicolaou The data say that the top topic choices for political TV ads in Iowa did not always match the issues voters considered to be the most important in that state. We want to tell this story because it provides insight into the logic of political TV ads during a primary, where the emphasis is less on pitting the voters against the rival political party but &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/03/03/political-tv-ads-not-what-you-think-theyre-about/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Political TV ads: not what you think they’re about</span></a>]]></description>

We want to tell this story to show that choosing to bike can make a difference. The Hubway Bike Share system launched in 2011, and completed over 1 million rides over the next two years. We decided to look at the benefits of biking on health and the environment, and &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/03/03/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-hubway/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">A Day in the Life of a Hubway</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[By Felipe Lozano-Landinez, Jane Coffrin, and Julia Appel The Political TV Ad Archive contains information about the televised ads during the 2016 primary campaign season. Our goal with this project was to explore this data set and see what interesting campaign strategy insights we could derive by looking at which candidates sponsored ads on which TV shows. To do this, we cleaned/modified the data set to specifically focus on candidates via what ads they sponsored (not &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/03/03/campaign-strategy-101-winning-hearts-and-minds/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Campaign Strategy 101: Winning Hearts and Minds</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[By Catherine Caruso, Kendra Pierre-Louis and Tiffany Wang Every year since 2008 the New York City based nonprofit, Center for an Urban Future has compiled a tally of the number of national retail chains located across the city. Underpinning their analysis is the unspoken assumption that retail chains are somehow a detriment to the fabric of the city. In that regards they have some support. &#8220;The unintended consequence of their [chain stores] victories through the &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/03/03/attack-of-the-chains/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Attack of the Chains?</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[By Judy Chang, Iris Fung, and Eric Lau The data say that SuperPACs supporting non-Trump candidates are more interested in attacking other non-Trump candidates than Donald Trump. We want to tell this story because it stands in stark contrast to the #NeverTrump movement. The news is dominated by the 2016 election, specifically by the negativity of the candidates’ campaigns. One of the chief contributors to this negativity are SuperPACs, which wield unlimited political spending power in &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/03/03/nevertrump-the-candidates-are-on-board-but-what-about-the-superpacs/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">#NeverTrump: The Candidates are On Board, but What About the SuperPACs?</span></a>]]></description>
