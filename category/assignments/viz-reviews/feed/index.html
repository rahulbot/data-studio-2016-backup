				<description><![CDATA[Original visualization and Author&#8217;s comments binvis.io isn&#8217;t so much a statement as an exploration of what files on computers &#8220;look like&#8221;. In essence, it takes a binary file containing arbitrary data and generates an interactive visualization which allows users to inspect regions of the file for values such as byteclass (useful for distinguishing text from other data, for example), local entropy, and byte-level details. Admittedly, the target audience of this presentation is likely technically-minded, but the key ideas apply to a lot of &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/02/08/visualizing-binary-data/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Visualizing Binary Data</span></a>]]></description>

The statements were grouped into six categories, ranging from pants-on-fire lies to true. The post is aimed at a wide audience, from adults who are trying to choose a candidate to the candidates and their teams.

				<description><![CDATA[The Fallen of World War II is an interactive, data-driven documentary about the casualties of WWII. The documentary&#8217;s punchline, however, is that despite contemporary sentiments and contrary to what the media may make us feel, we are in fact living in a period of &#8216;long peace&#8217;. What this means is that we are now less likely than ever before in the recorded history of mankind (!) to die in battle.

Unfortunately, the unseasonably warm weather lately has made training very difficult. This is a chart of yearly snowfall at the team’s home mountain, Ragged Mountain, from opensnow.com. It shows for each season from 2010-11 until now, what percentage of average snowfall the mountain has had.
