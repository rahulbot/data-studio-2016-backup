				<description><![CDATA[Team: Michelle Thomas, Phillip Graham, Argyro Nicolaou The data says that 16,214 out of more than 670,000 refugees resettled in the US since 2005 are hosted in Massachusetts. We want to tell the story of resettled refugees because the integration challenges that refugee populations face is something that should involve the entire host community. For this project, our intended audience is native Massachusetts residents. The aim of the project is to make native MA residents &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/03/15/getting-to-know-the-refugee-populations-of-massachusetts/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Getting to know the refugee populations of Massachusetts</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Jyotishka Biswas, Eric Lau, Kalki Seksaria, Tiffany Wang The data say that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton differ wildly both in political ideology and in general truthfulness, with Clinton trumping Trump in the latter. We want to tell this story because with the upcoming election, it&#8217;s important that people know both where the candidates stand and what they will say to gain political support. In celebration (trepidation?) of the upcoming election, we looked at two data &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/03/15/swaying-from-truth-candidates-and-their-issues/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Swaying from Truth: Candidates and Their Positions on Issues</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Team Members: Catherine Caruso, Jane Coffrin, Iris Fung, Katie Marlowe The data say that a higher school performance correlates with a lower number of out of school suspensions. In addition, schools that only administer in school suspensions perform higher than schools that administer out of school suspensions. We want to tell this story because we’d like to advise the Louisiana State School Board against current methods of discipline that may not be good for the &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/03/15/do-out-of-school-suspensions-correlate-with-school-performance/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Do out of school suspensions correlate with school performance?</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Judy Chang, Gary Burnett, Andrew Mikofalvy We chose to use the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) as our dataset, accumulating the injury reports from 2009 to 2014.  The data logs all injuries related to consumer products reported by a probability sample of hospitals across the country. We filtered the dataset to only look at injuries caused by fireworks. We want to tell this story because we want to raise awareness about the dangers of using fireworks. &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/03/14/368/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Fireworks: Fun &#38; Dangerous</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[By: Kenny Friedman, Mike Drachkovitch, and Felipe Lozano-Landinez The data say that it costs about $65,000, on average, to integrate a refugee into the United States over a period of five years. We want to tell this story because in today&#8217;s political environment, which is exhibiting significant anti-immigrant and anti-refugee rhetoric, it is important to understand what it would actually take to grant asylum to global citizens in need in 2016.
