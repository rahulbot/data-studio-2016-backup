				<description><![CDATA[By: Jyotishka Biswas, Kalki Seksaria, Mike Drachkovitch, and Felipe Lozano-Landinez The data says that there are thousands of refugees entering the European Union every week. The current massive migration of refugees to the EU presents both a moral and resource-constraint issue to the countries receiving the influx. Decisions about how to balance the inherent trade-off are made by political leaders in all of these countries in a real-time, imperfect information environment.

				<description><![CDATA[Group Members: Argyro Nicolaou, Reem Alfaiz, Phillip Graham, Gary Burnett The data say that there are many people immigrating to Europe. In 2015 alone, more than 1 million people arrived to Europe by sea. The numbers are increasing every year. In the first 3 months of 2016 the number of sea arrivals was 6 times greater, than the same time in the previous year. This influx of refugees will put a lot of stress on &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/04/12/donate-by-playing-a-fundraising-board-game-for-the-international-federation-of-red-cross-and-red-crescent-societies/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Donate by Playing &#8211; A Fundraising Board Game for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[By: Catherine Caruso, Judy Chang, Kendra Pierre-Louis, Tiffany Wang For this assignment we created a Buzzfeed quiz. You can take the quiz here. The data say that since Hubway’s inception in 2011, ridership has increased. In fact, earlier this month Hubway had its 4-millionth ride. However most of its riders were born between 1981-1986. People in their early to mid-thirties make up 38-percent of Hubway riders. Yet those born after 1991, currently only make up &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/04/12/how-much-do-you-actually-know-about-commuting-in-boston/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">How Much Do You Actually Know About Commuting In Boston?</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Michelle Thomas, Katie Marlowe, and Jane Coffrin The data say that people are most frequently using Hubway on weekdays and that some stops are more utilized than others, such as South Station and MIT at Mass Ave.  We want to tell this story because if more people take advantage of what Hubway has to offer, it can lead to enjoyment, health benefits and environmental benefits . Our audience is existing Hubway users and encouraging new users &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/04/12/explore-hubway/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Explore Hubway</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Julia Appel, Iris Fung, Eric Lau The data says that in Boston, more than 30% of work commuters depend on the T to get to work and that biking is a faster and healthier way to do it. Within city limits, biking often saves time when compared to the T. Furthermore, bike commuting helps Bostonians stay healthy and active, adding up to 50 minutes/day of moderate to vigorous activity with an average round-trip commute.

				<description><![CDATA[By Maddie Kim, Andrew Mikofalvy, and Kenny Friedman The Set Up Life as a refugee is often extremely difficult, from having to leave your friends and relatives, to fear of persecution. Many factors that should not matter to the successful application to this country do make a difference on the likelihood of making it to the United States. As we’ve seen in the past, the US has more than enough resources to increase the number &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/04/11/project4/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">What is Immigration</span></a>]]></description>
