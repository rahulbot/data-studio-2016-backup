				<description><![CDATA[View our infographic (use Google Chrome for best results) Our main goal of this project was to convey how sizable of a problem hunger in this country is, and how food waste, which is also a huge problem which we all contribute to, is a possible solution to the problem. We want viewers to understand that while we, as individuals, waste a lot of food, grocery stores are also a big contributor to this problem.

				<description><![CDATA[View our infographic (use Google Chrome for best results) We originally wanted to work with homelessness data again after the 5th mini-project due to the large quantity of data and relative cleanness, but could not find a concrete call-to-action to frame our story around. We brainstormed some alternative ideas; the strongest alternative was to tackle childhood obesity by drawing on CDC data, with a call to action of either encouraging kids to write letters to “Save &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/05/12/methodology-of-uglyfruit/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Methodology of UglyFruit</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Team Members: Gary Burnett, Phillip Graham, Katie Marlowe The data say that states that have a higher ratio of beds for the homeless to the amount of homeless people more frequently had a decrease in the number of homeless people from 2014-2015. We want to tell this story because the homelessness epidemic is a big problem. There are 564,708 homeless people in the United States, and transitional housing is helping to lower this number.

In addition, schools that only administer in school suspensions perform higher than schools that administer out of school suspensions. We want to tell this story because we’d like to advise the Louisiana State School Board against current methods of discipline that may not be good for the &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/03/15/do-out-of-school-suspensions-correlate-with-school-performance/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Do out of school suspensions correlate with school performance?</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[Aneesh Agrawal, Kenny Friedman, and Katie Marlowe The data show routes that people commonly take by using Hubways. We want to tell this story because Hubway can be a great alternative transportation for routes that the MBTA does not cover. Our data came from hubwaydatachallenge.org, which was a challenge in 2012 to visualize data from Hubway rides. Our data includes information on rides from 2011-2013. We picked a chord chart to visualize this data because &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/03/03/hubway-rides-by-neighborhood-over-time/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Hubway Rides by Neighborhood over Time</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[As a member of the MIT Ski Team, I frequently look at the upcoming forecasts, hoping for more snow. Unfortunately, the unseasonably warm weather lately has made training very difficult. This is a chart of yearly snowfall at the team’s home mountain, Ragged Mountain, from opensnow.com. It shows for each season from 2010-11 until now, what percentage of average snowfall the mountain has had. The chart uses circles of different heights to correspond to that’s &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/02/04/ragged-mountain-snowfall/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Ragged Mountain Snowfall</span></a>]]></description>
