This report contained data about so-called FIO (Field Interrogation and Observation) incidents between 2007 and 2010, and many of the findings point out the disproportionate amount of African Americans that have been stopped on the streets. We used the Boston &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/04/26/stopped/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Stopped.</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[By: Catherine Caruso, Judy Chang, Kendra Pierre-Louis, Tiffany Wang For this assignment we created a Buzzfeed quiz. You can take the quiz here. The data say that since Hubway’s inception in 2011, ridership has increased. In fact, earlier this month Hubway had its 4-millionth ride. However most of its riders were born between 1981-1986. People in their early to mid-thirties make up 38-percent of Hubway riders. Yet those born after 1991, currently only make up &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/04/12/how-much-do-you-actually-know-about-commuting-in-boston/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">How Much Do You Actually Know About Commuting In Boston?</span></a>]]></description>

				<description><![CDATA[By Kendra Pierre-Louis, Michael Drachkovitch, Jyotishka Biswas, and Tiffany Wang The data say that in 2015, 1145 people were killed by the police in the United States. We wanted to tell this story because the question of how many people the police kill and who they kill has become a contentious issue. Our goal was to get people to think about the issue of police killings in a less inflammatory manner. Rather than frame the debate around &#8230; <a href="https://datastudio2016.datatherapy.org/2016/03/31/comparing-the-counted-a-juxtaposition-of-two-police-cultures/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="screen-reader-text">Comparing ‘The Counted’: A Juxtaposition of Two Police Cultures</span></a>]]></description>
